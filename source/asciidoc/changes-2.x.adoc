== 监听1.5.x版本的Spring Boot  ==

. Reconfigure the api path for Spring Boot Admin Client 1.5.x:
+
[source,yml]
.application.yml
----
spring.boot.admin.api-path: instances
----

As some of the actuator endpoints changed with the Spring Boot 2 release not all options might be available
(e.g. `/metrics` endpoint); for some of the endpoints we provide legacy converters.
